Hi... 
The graphic variations did not appear to me and I wanted to write something that reflects my words. 
Writing in Python seemed to me unacceptably simple, but turning to GoLang was considered the most correct, because now it occupies a significant importance in your life. 
I honestly watched the lessons on the Internet, but I couldn't understand much behind the tears... 
I prepared several codes, 
missed several important installations on PyCharm, 
could not cope with the names of text files, 
and the last straw was a broken terminal with the function of launching the program. 
I was desperate. 
I decided to look at how we wrote before, 
and our cute memo with a "pjureshka" turned out to be what I had been trying to write for three hours. 
I'm sorry, I still couldn't figure out how to remove the looping when the answer is negative, but here's what I got...
